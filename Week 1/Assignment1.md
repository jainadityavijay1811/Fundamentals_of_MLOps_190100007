# Week 1 Solutions

## Question 1
### Part 1
Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations, or AIOps, is a multi-layered technology that enhances IT operations and enables machines to solve IT problems without human assistance. AIOps uses analytics and machine learning to analyse big data, and detect and respond to IT issues in real-time, automatically. For core technology functions in big data and machine learning, AIOps works as continuous integration and deployment.

Compared to MLOps, AIOps is a narrower practice that automates IT functions using machine learning. The goal of MLOps is to bridge the gap between operation teams and data scientists, and consequently between the execution and development of ML models. In contrast, the focus of AIOps is smart analysis of root causes and automated management of IT incidents.

### Part 2

The higher the interpretability of a machine learning model, the easier it is for someone to comprehend why certain decisions or predictions have been made. A model is better interpretable than another model if its decisions are easier for a human to comprehend than decisions from the other model.

#### Interpretation of a Numerical Feature
An increase of feature x_k by one unit increases the prediction for y by Î²_k units when all other feature values remain fixed.
